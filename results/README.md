# ðŸ“Š Results

This directory is for outputs generated by analysis, experiments, or simulations.

## What to Include

- Figures and plots (e.g., `.png`, `.pdf`, `.svg`)
- Tables, CSV files, or summary statistics
- Processed data outputs ready for interpretation or publication
- Intermediate results that are expensive to reproduce

## Guidelines

- Organize by script or notebook if helpful (`results/from-analysis/`, `results/simulation-run1/`)
- Use consistent, descriptive filenames (e.g., `accuracy-plot.png`, `model-output.csv`)
- Avoid committing large files unless needed for publication or reproducibility
- Consider tracking output with `DVC` or metadata to support reproducibility

## Version Control Notes

If files are large or binary (e.g., `.mov`, `.exr`, `.tiff`), use [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) and include patterns in `.gitattributes`.

Use `.gitignore` for files that donâ€™t need to be committed, like logs or temporary caches.

```
*.log
*.tmp
.cache/
```

## Publishing

You can link to or embed results in Quarto documents located in `docs/`. To include a figure:

```markdown
![Accuracy over time](../results/accuracy-plot.png)
```

To embed a table from CSV:

```{.python}
import pandas as pd
pd.read_csv("../results/summary.csv")
```
